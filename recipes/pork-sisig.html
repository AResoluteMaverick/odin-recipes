    <h3> About Pork Sisig: A Description </h3>

    <p> 
        Pork sisig is a dish native to the Philippines, born around the World Wars. It was originally a "poor mans meal" as it's ingredients were
        mostly a mix of pig ears, tails, fat, meat, and other scraps that could've been made during war. However, it has
        since progressed to such a refine state and flavor, that everyone could enjoy it. It is crispy, savory, and overall delicious to the tongue.
